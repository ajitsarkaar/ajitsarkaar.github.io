[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"Hello friend! Nice to see you here!\nLet me tell you a bit about myself. I am a masters student in The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech conducting research in Computer Vision using Deep Learning architectures under the guidance of Dr. A.L. Abbott. I work on solving problems related to panoptic image segmentation and scene understanding which have applications across a broad range of domains. I worked as a Research Intern at Amazon last summer and have TA\u0026rsquo;d for some highly popular courses such as Computer Vision and Artificial Intelligence at Virginia Tech. When I\u0026rsquo;m not in front of a computer, I play semi-professional soccer, click some photos and explore the exciting field of Cosmology. I hope to experience interstellar travel someday (hope :P). If you\u0026rsquo;re visiting this page, it is highly likely that we share some common interest and could help each other. I\u0026rsquo;d love it if we connected via some social channel. My info is to the left.\nLook forward to meeting you!

<h2>Course Overview</h2>
<table class="imgtable"><tr><td>
<img src="photos/logo.png" alt="alt text" width="270px" height="220px" />&nbsp;</td>
<td align="left"><p>This course will cover the foundations of modern artificial intelligence (AI) and many of the key ideas that have resonated throughout its history. It will focus on concepts that are not only important in the space of AI but are also practically useful in modern applications. We will practice effective methods of reasoning about AI problems, which will generalize beyond the specific topics we study in class.<br /><br />
Class meets on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 3:30 PM to 4:45 PM in Surge 107.</p>

<h2>Topics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Search: heuristic search, A*, adversarial search and game playing</p>
</li>
<li><p>Probability and learning: reasoning under uncertainty, reinforcement learning, temporal modeling</p>
</li>
<li><p>Logic and knowledge: propositional, first-order, reasoning, planning, knowledge representation</p>
</li>
<li><p>Applications: self-driving cars, assistants, personalized health, and more.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<p>The only official prerequisite is CS 3114 (Undergraduate Data Structures and Algorithms). You should be comfortable with discrete mathematics, basic probability and statistics, basic logic, computational complexity, data structures, and algorithm analysis. The homework assignments will include programming portions using Python 2.7.15.<br />
Please speak with the instructor if you are concerned about your background.</p>
<h2>Accessibility</h2>
<p>If any student needs special accommodations because of any disabilities, please contact the instructor during the first week of classes. Such students are encouraged to work with The Office of Services for Students with Disabilities to help coordinate accessibility arrangements.</p>

<h2>Grading Scale</h2>
<p>Based on the grading breakdown above, each student's final grade for the course will be determined by the final percentage of points earned. The grade ranges are as follows:
A    93.3–100    A-    90.0–93.3    B+    86.6–90.0    B    83.3–86.6.   B-    80.0–83.3<br /> 
C<tt>   76.6–80.0   C     73.3–76.6    C-    70.0–73.3 D</tt> 66.6<tt>–70.0</tt> D 63.3<tt>–66.6</tt> 
D- 60.0<tt>–63.3</tt> F 00.0<tt>–60.0</tt></p>
<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>
<p>The Undergraduate Honor Code pledge that each member of the university community agrees to abide by states:<br /><tt>"As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do."</tt><br />
Students enrolled in this course are responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the course instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Ignorance of the rules does not exclude any member of the University community from the requirements and expectations of the Honor Code. For additional information about the Honor Code, please visit: https:<i></i>www.honorsystem.vt.edu/<br />
This course will have a zero-tolerance philosophy regarding plagiarism or other forms of cheating. Your homework assignments must be your own work, and any external source of code, ideas, or language must be cited to give credit to the original source. I will not hesitate to report incidents of academic dishonesty to the Office of the Undergraduate Honor System.</p>
<h2>Principles of Community</h2>
<p>Because the course will include in-class discussions, we will adhere to Virginia Tech's Principles of Community. The first two principles are most relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>We affirm the inherent dignity and value of every person and strive to maintain a climate for work and learning based on mutual respect and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li><p>We affirm the right of each person to express thoughts and opinions freely. We encourage open expression within a climate of civility, sensitivity, and mutual respect.<br />
The remaining principles are also important and we will take them seriously as a class.</p>
</li>
</ul>
